			<div class="expand-container">
				<h2 class=""><img class = "crossRotateN" src = "showLeft.png"/>   Estonia</h2>
				<p class = "negShow">Many people leave Estonia and go to countries in Europe, because the wages are higher. Many will migrate to Finland (80km away) because salaries are about three times higher than the salaries in Estonia, but the living costs are very similar. Also the low job opportunities and sparse education are another factor for migration. Some residents live in debt because of their low paying job, but can't switch professions due to the basic education. </p>

			<div class="expand-container">
				<h2 class=""><img class = "crossRotateN" src = "showLeft.png"/>   Bulgaria</h2>
				<p class = "negShow">One reason behind Bulgaria's decreasing population is due to the fertility rate. A lot of the Bulgarian Population is quite old, and unable to reproduce. Another factor is migration. Bulgaria has been losing people at a pretty fast rate. Bulgaria experiences about a 10% population loss. </p>

			<div class = "lineN line2N">-0.61%</div>
			<div class="expand-container">
				<h2 class=""><img class = "crossRotateN" src = "showLeft.png"/>   Moldova</h2>
				<p class = "negShow">Moldova has a very low pay rate compared to the minimum wage needed to survive. Due to this, many residents will emigrate out for economic reasons. Because of this economic disaster, many people also don't want to go back to Moldova. </p>

			<div class = "lineN line3N">-1.05%</div>
			<div class="expand-container">
				<h2 class=""><img class = "crossRotateN" src = "showLeft.png"/>   Latvia</h2>
				<p class = "negShow">Due to Latvia's association with the EU, 20% of the nation has left to work in wealthier countries. This economic migration is one of the big reasons why Latvia's population is declining. Some reasons in Latvia have extremely low wages, so it's no wonder why some people would choose to emigrate out.</p>

			<div class = "lineN line4N">-1.08%</div>
			<div class="expand-container">
				<h2 class=""><img class = "crossRotateN" src = "showLeft.png"/>   Lithuania</h2>
				<p class = "negShow">Ever since the change from communism to capitalism, the population started decreasing. People were raised to live like a communist, and when Lithuania turned capitalist, very little people new what to do. Also, many criminal gangs and mafia were present. This political instability lead many people to emigrate out of Lithuania. Many of these immigrants will emigrate to the EU, which has better prospects for the future.</p>

			<div class="expand-container">
				<h2 class=""><img class = "crossRotateN" src = "showLeft.png"/>   Saint Pierre and Miquelon</h2>
				<p class = "negShow">Ever since the 1920's, the population has been declining. After the prohibition of alcohol, their economy has been going down-hill. Currently, their economy is based on fishing, but Saint Pierre and Miquelon and Canada are having disputes over fishing quotas. Also, to get an education at a university, inhabitants must travel to other places to get their formal education. </p>

			<div class="expand-container">
				<h2 class=""><img class = "crossRotateN" src = "showLeft.png"/>   Lebanon</h2>
				<p class = "negShow">Lebanon is quite small, so many Lebanese are forced to live elsewhere. About 15 million Lebanese people live outside of Lebanon, and around 4.1 million live inside. Many who wish to return can’t, as the country isn’t big enough to support all those people. Also because Brazil (which houses around 7 million Lebanese) has a lot of Christians, many Christian Lebanese will emigrate to Brazil to flee religious persecution.	</p>

			<div class="expand-container">
				<h2 class=""><img class = "crossRotateN" src = "showLeft.png"/>   American Samoa</h2>
				<p class = "negShow">In American Samoa, regardless of population, resources will continue to decline. They depend heavily on imported goods, sometimes up to thousands of miles away! This means that prices for foods can get pretty high. As a result, as of 2017, about 26 to 27 people per 1000 leave American Samoa.</p>

			<div class = "lineN line8N">-1.3%</div>
			<div class="expand-container">
				<h2 class=""><img class = "crossRotateN" src = "showLeft.png"/>   Puerto Rico</h2>
				<p class = "negShow">Puerto Rico's population has been decreasing because many Puerto Ricans will migrate to the states (primarily Florida). Since Hurricane Maria, 239,000 Puerto Ricans moved to the US. This really affects Puerto Rico, because it leaves its economy damaged. If the Puerto Ricans move back, they will find the economy being worse than it was when they left.</p>

			<div class="expand-container">
				<h2 class=""><img class = "crossRotateN" src = "showLeft.png"/>   Cook Islands</h2>
				<p class = "negShow">Cook Islands' population has been decreasing because Cook Islanders have New Zealand citizenship. Cook Islanders also have a major disadvantage for economic oppurtunities. This causes many islanders to migrate to New Zealand. Also, the fertility rate has been decreasing over the years.</p>
