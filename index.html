			<p>Ever since the Industrial Revolution, the population has started to increase rapidly. The human population reached 1 billion in 1804. 123 years later, we hit 2 billion. Then just 33 years later, the population was 3 billion! Currently, we have more than 7.6 billion people on this planet. But Earth's resources are finite, and one day, they will run out. How many people is too many? Or will progressing technology allow the human population to increase to trillions?</p>
