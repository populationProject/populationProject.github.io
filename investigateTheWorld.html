			<p>When it comes to the carbon footprint of each country, Lesotho is near the bottom of the list. Per-person, the average emission in Lesotho as of 2010 was 0.1 tons of carbon dioxide compared to a worldwide average of 4 tons. The small carbon footprint left by the average person in Lesotho can, in part, be attributed to the fact that nearly 90% of households in Lesotho don't have access to an energy grid and only 16% of the population has electricity. Additionally, all of Lesotho's electricity comes from hydropower and 11% of the country's energy comes from other forms of renewable energy. If every human lived like an average person from Lesotho, well under one Earth would be needed to sustain the current population. However, more and more people are moving to villages and the population continues to increase, which is likely to increase the carbon footprint. Therefore, Lesotho is looking into many ways to reduce their energy consumption and, consequently, their carbon footprint.</p>
			<p>	The leading sources of greenhouse gas emissions in Lesotho are land-use and forestry. Although this sector re-absorbs some if it'â€˜s emissions(largely through abandoned land), substantial amounts of greenhouse gases are released from agriculturally impacted soils and grassland conversions. Emissions released from agriculture are largely produced from the burning of rangelands, enteric fermentation within livestock(which makes up about 30% of methane emissions worldwide), as well as from waste. Waste is a major producer of greenhouse gases in Lesotho, particularly agricultural waste. There is no national waste-management system (including sewage system), so each person is left to deal with their own agricultural waste and human waste.</p>
			<p>Additionally, trees and scrubs are a major source of energy for rural communities in Lesotho and are a producer of greenhouse gases. The majority of domestic energy, including energy in small-scale commercial sectors, usage is reliant on fuelwood. Reducing the demand for firewood would reduce deforestation and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Some strategies that would result in a lower demand for firewood are fuel-efficient stoves. An energy efficient household project, which aims to distribute efficient wood stoves, could potentially decrease the use of fuelwood by 80%. If deforestation in Lesotho is reversed, and 200 ha(hectares, or 10,000 square meters) of forest are planted every year, there could be nearly 40,000 t(metric tons) of carbon dioxide emissions reductions per 200 ha of forest. Both reforestation and afforestation --the planting of trees in an area with no previous tree cover-- provide potential in decreasing climate change in Lesotho. </p>
			<p>	Another source of greenhouse gases in Lesotho is the production of charcoal. Although the reduction of the use of firewood in Lesotho is a step that can be taken to reduce Lesotho's greenhouse gas emissions, firewood would be a more eco-friendly alternative to the production of charcoal that is currently being used. The annual charcoal production in Lesotho for 2011 was approximately 96,631 t (metric tons). If fuelwood (from sustainable plantations) was used in place of all of Lesotho's charcoal production, instead of the open kiln production that is currently in use, emissions reductions could be as high as 75,082 t (metric tons) carbon dioxide per year. </p>
			<p>	Despite Lesotho being at the bottom end of the spectrum when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, efforts are still being made to reduce the country's emissions. Worldwide (especially in the United States), the average person lives with a much greater carbon footprint than the average person from Lesotho. Therefore, if Lesotho has the ability to reduce their very small carbon footprint, than countries with a much higher footprint most certainly should be able to reduce their emissions. Furthermore, Lesotho is a much less prosperous country than many of the world's top emitters, and Lesotho uses an extremely high amount of renewable energy. More technologically advanced and economically prosperous countries should, without a doubt, have the ability to use renewable energy for a large portion of their energy, which would greatly reduce each country's carbon footprint. Although, it is unrealistic to think that everyone on Earth could live like someone from Lesotho, and it is important to keep in mind that a balance between quality of life and carbon footprint must be maintained.  It is clear that countries across the globe have the ability to reduce their carbon footprint, as demonstrated by Lesotho.</p>
